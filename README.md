# P3-Spam-Mail-Classification-by-NLP-and-ML

<h1>Spam Email Detection</h1>

<p>This project is designed to detect spam emails using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to create a reliable and efficient spam classification model that can help reduce the impact of spam emails on users, improving email security and productivity. The model leverages text preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning algorithms to classify emails as either "Spam" or "Not Spam."</p>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

<p>Programming Language: Python
  
#Libraries:

sklearn for machine learning and text vectorization.

pandas and numpy for data manipulation and analysis.

pickle for model serialization and deployment.

Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code
